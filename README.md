1. Structure:
   - The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
   - It uses JavaFX for the user interface.

2. Key Components:
   - App.java: The main application class that sets up the primary stage.
   - AppController.java: Handles the business logic and interactions between the model and view.
   - AppView.java: Manages the user interface components and layout.
   - Feature.java: Defines various fitness-related features like exercises and sleep tracking.
   - FitnessUser.java: Represents a user of the application with fitness-specific attributes.
   - Systems.java: Manages user accounts and authentication.

3. Functionality:
   - User authentication (login, logout, account creation)
   - Tracking physical activities (exercises)
   - Monitoring sleep
   - Calculating BMI and calories burned
   - Setting fitness goals (lose weight, gain weight, maintain weight)
   - Maintaining a fitness history with daily logs

4. JavaFX Concepts Used:
   - Properties (SimpleStringProperty, SimpleDoubleProperty, etc.)
   - Event handling with lambda expressions
   - Observable lists (implied by the use of JavaFX)

5. Notable Features:
   - Encryption for user passwords
   - Different calculation methods for exercise calories (per exercise or duration-based)
   - Improvement tracking over time

The project seems to have a solid foundation with user management and basic fitness tracking capabilities. However, it appears that the user interface for displaying fitness data, exercise logging, and history viewing is not fully implemented in the provided code snippets.

To enhance this project, you might want to focus on:
1. Implementing views for displaying user's fitness data
2. Creating interfaces for logging exercises and sleep
3. Developing a dashboard to show progress towards fitness goals
4. Adding visualization components like charts to display fitness trends

Would you like me to suggest a specific area to work on or expand?
